##Overview 

Bandwhich is a music app designed for users to discover music by local independant singer-songwriters.  

It is written with a rails backend and react-redux frontend and uses Bandcamp (bandcamp.com) as a design inspiration.

All music and images are original content from myself and friends, and are hosted using AWS S3 Simple Storage.  Other 

technologies used include Postgresql, jquery, Jbuilder, vanilla Javascript and react-router.

Here is a link to the live site: https://bandwhich.herokuapp.com/#/.
